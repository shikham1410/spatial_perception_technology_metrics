         After understanding these co-relationships in depth and studying repeating patterns in the readings, I could develop:
        <ul>
            <li>A list of end readings that essentially become a quantification method for recording the factor of Novelty in the projects (marked in colors). These, when applied to the framework, generate a second layer of readings that are recorded as numerical values. [Reading I]</li>
            <li>Sub-factors playing the roles of an Active Initiator, and an Active Executor to understand implications for the Design Practice. [Reading II]</li>

        <div class="Description"> A hierarchal matrix charting method would adopted to develop a framework for application on case studies. As the six main factors were determined earlier, the relevant sub-factors were filtered through multiple literature studies, and by conducting relevant secondary research on design practices and projects.Each inter-relation is charted at the observed intersections, followed by an elaborate note in the thesis as to how X impacts Y and/or Y impacts X. </div>

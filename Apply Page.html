         <a class="Description"> The following case-study example is an analysis of the spatial project Georges Cafe,Paris by Jakob+MacFarlane. The project was studied through the lens if the parameters mentioned in the thesis. A detailed observational analysis was followed by the development of important factors and sub-factors that impact the user perception in the space, the impact of production technology,techniques, methods of construction, stakeholder involvement and the changing nature of design practice. A matrix is hence derived to analyse an appopriate space. Secondary subfactors then emerge that act as 'Active Iniators' and 'Active Eanblers/ Executors' in the design process for a particular project. Multiple projects can hence be analysed and compared through this framework. </a>
